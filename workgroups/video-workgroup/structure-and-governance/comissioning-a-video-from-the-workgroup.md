# Comissioning a video from the workgroup

### <mark style="background-color:purple;">Commissioning videos: what do you need to tell us?</mark>

If you have a video, and you want to commission the video workgroup to make some clips from it or to make a video from scratch based on some text document. You need to give us a clear brief, here’s how:

1. **Specify the parts you want made into clips (or videos):**

* If you can, give the start and end timestamps of the sections of your video that you want. If you want the editor to also edit out silences, speaker hesitations, or other empty content, or to correct audio clipping, bad color balance, etc, you need to say this clearly. Check with your editor so that they can make the corrections you want.
* Suppose you can’t give timestamps, at least state the topics that you want to have clips of. Don’t leave it to the editor to decide what’s important; remember, they do not know your content or message, and might not be able to form a qualitative understanding of it.&#x20;
* Provide a script, an article, or any other type of resource that will be used to make the video from scratch.

2. **Specify how long you want the clip(s)  (or video) to be, and how many clips (Be as specific as possible.)**



2. **Specify any text, subtitles, or other elements you want added:**

* Provide us with the text you want, or commission us to make it for you.
* Share the link of a folder with all logos, files, etc (Google Drive, Dropbox,...).&#x20;
* Ask us in advance what quality you need for any elements you’re adding (file formats, resolutions, etc) and check that your material conforms.

4. **Specify any colors, fonts, images, and logos that you want to use:**

Within sNET, it will be SNet colors and fonts. But if you have any special requests, include them in the brief.

5. **Timelines specification:**

Say clearly how flexible your dates are or aren’t; factor in time for checking and corrections; and try not to give us rush jobs! Based on this, we can agree on a date for the first draft.

6. **What to check:**

* Is the clip the right length?
* Is the audio: loud enough, clear?
* Are the transitions smooth?
* Has the editor removed things that you wanted removed (speaker hesitations; silences; etc)?
* Are the right logos included?
* Are there typos in any text that’s been used?

7. **Corrections process:**

* The project commissioner will be made in direct contact with the Video workgroup member(s) working on the project.
* Any edits or corrections will be directly communicated to the members in charge.
* Any conflict arising from this process can be raised to the workgroup lead and will be discussed in the next workgroup meeting as an agenda item.
