# How rewards are distributed

Current monthly budget is 62,500 AGIX. Unspend budget carries over to the next month(s).

Disbursement of tokens will happen at the last day of the month, currently by manual transaction until Dework supports Cardano native assets.

AGIX will be sent on Cardano, ambassadors need to provide their public wallet address.

The fees for sending the rewards are paid for by SingularityNET.

All transactions will be shared with a link to their cardanoscan page.
