# How do we manage Financial Resources?

### Here is a list of the tools and documents:

* [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas) - A tool where all workgroups create bounties for the community.
* [Treasury Management - GitBook Page](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/group-1/treasury-management) - This page shares information on Ambassador Program treasury rules around payments, tasks, and anything related to financial activities.
* [Ambassador Tools - Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFAp0dm5Tmoh29EgxC9r5XTey\_EWeb9lRdrI0JCpbPk/edit?usp=sharing) - This document collects information about licenses we may want to use or use in the Ambassador Program
* [Treasury Dashboard - Analytics Website](https://treasuryguild.com/Singularity%20Net) - Ambassador Program Reward distribution Dashboard
* [Treasury Dapp - Code GIT](https://github.com/treasuryguild/treasury-dapp) - A dapp, mostly JavaScript, to create treasury management transactions
* [Treasury dashboard - Code GIT](https://github.com/treasuryguild/treasury-dashboard) - This is the repo for the treasury dashboard. Built with JavaScript.
* [Dework PBL Cardano Wallet Lesson - Andamio Lesson](https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-396alii9p-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/101/1014) - We build trust with people by educating them.

### Each workgroup has its own way of managing its internal financial resources. Examples:

* [Dework PBL Workgroup Roles and resource allocation - Miro Board Window ](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7pbrUg=/?moveToWidget=3458764559517993230\&cot=14)- This Miro Board Area describes the roles, rewards, and skills required for the role. In addition, you can see active members who have picked up the role.
