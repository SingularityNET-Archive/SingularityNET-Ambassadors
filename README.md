## Welcome!

The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is dedicated to building public awareness of decentralised AI/AGI, and of the SingularityNET ecosystem. It provides structure and rewards to community members who are contributing towards a beneficial [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_general\_intelligence).&#x20;

## Core values&#x20;

The core values of our Ambassador program are&#x20;

* **transparency**
* **decentralisation, and**
* **involvement.**&#x20;

This means community members are fully involved in decision-making, including decisions on how tokens are spent. We do this through our weekly Town Hall meetings, which are open to all; and through various other experiments in contribution-based, decentralised decision-making.

Together, we can work towards creating a world where AGI benefits all of humanity.
