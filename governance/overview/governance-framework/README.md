## Notes: <a href="#_i7vh9c9qivsd" id="_i7vh9c9qivsd"></a>

Won't be finished at any state

Living document which will evolve into version documents ( E.g V1, v2 etc )

Define updates and change proposals to the document (similar to CIP process ?) (just without door keepers such as CIP’s & IOG)

## To be discussed <a href="#_5up6vf51ikpr" id="_5up6vf51ikpr"></a>

* Version control versus concurrency. My thought is version control. I believe it eliminates potential confusion. I do believe concurrency should exist in this living document, but until a Consensus or Consent is achieved by the community only the adopted Version should be the guide.
* Ideate and define signing process

( Multisig on Ambassador NFT & Workgroup holders to order the transaction to Treasury Guild ? ) I am exploring Summon Platform and their multisig.

* Ideate and define a incubation process to establish new roles, workgroups and Guilds

* How to include AI tools & services in the Governance framework ?
* Idea a framework of an Ambassador university (sNET Academy ?)
* Define a conflict resolution process
* Define a Code of Ethics
* Define the visualisation of SingularityNET Ambassador Program as a structural functional organisation.

( Check in with Tevo for Miro Board visualisation )

Glad you kept it simple!!!!!

As a community striving for social decentralisation, we can take inspiration from biological processes to contextualise how we develop symbiotic relationships with the wide ecosystem

TO DO:

* Set up Git version of the document (check in with QADAO)
* Creating a Ambassadors Governance Gitbook
* Creating voice format of the document
* Create a Onchain document on the Cardano Blockchain

Related call on that from April 13th 2023

* Create Video formats to introduce & explain the framework (check in with VW & Marketing)
