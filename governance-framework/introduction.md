Let's try to find a way where everyone here feels comfortable to create together an environment in which we want to be and through which we are able to identify ourselves with. Lets learn from mistakes in history in order to innovate future…?.

This framework and the dedicated process being found and built as you read, and to empower engaged contributors, emphasize decentralization, and foster diversity and inclusion within the program. By developing the principles, design, and implementation strategies of the new governance framework, the whitepaper aims to provide a clear roadmap for engaged souls at the SingularityNET Ambassador program to better understand and adapt to the emerging system we build.

Moreover, the whitepaper serves as a comprehensive reference document for those interested in the inner workings of the SingularityNET Ambassadors program and its governance model.

It strives to ensure transparency and encourages open discussion, feedback, and collaboration within the community to continuously improve the framework.

Ultimately, the whitepaper seeks to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed governance framework and establish a solid foundation for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program as it continues to evolve and grow within an decentralized and on-chain AI ecosystem .

### **1.2. Background and Context**

The SingularityNET Ambassadors program was established in April 2022 to harness the passion and talents of community members, allowing them to contribute to the growth and development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. The program has seen the formation of various workgroups and guilds, each focusing on specific projects and areas of activity, ranging from content creation and translation to outreach and technical support.

As the program has grown and evolved, it has become increasingly important to have a robust and effective governance framework in place. This framework should enable decision-making processes that are decentralized, transparent, and fair, prioritizing the contributions and engagement of active members over the influence of token holders or popularity contests.

The development of a governance framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program is not only essential for the program's long-term success but also serves as an example for other decentralized projects and communities seeking to establish their own governance structures.

This document is set against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving world of decentralized AI and blockchain technology, in which innovative governance models are crucial for fostering growth, collaboration, and sustainability. By outlining the proposed governance framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program, this whitepaper contributes to the broader conversation on decentralized governance and provides a model that can be adapted and adopted by other projects within the ecosystem.

### **1.3. Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of this whitepaper is to present a comprehensive and detailed outline of the proposed governance framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program. To achieve this goal, the whitepaper aims to:

1. Define and explain the core principles and assumptions that underpin the governance framework, emphasizing aspects such as decentralization, empowerment of engaged contributors, and the importance of diversity and inclusion.
2. Provide a clear and concise description of the key components of the governance framework, including the use of project/guild native assets, token cycles, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making, and the implementation of NFTs for capturing engagements.
3. Offer guidance and strategies for the successful implementation and adoption of the governance framework, including a transition plan, stakeholder involvement, community onboarding path with ecosystem education, and monitoring and evaluation processes.
4. Encourage open discussion, feedback, and collaboration within the SingularityNET community and among stakeholders, to continuously refine and improve the governance framework and ensure its effectiveness in meeting the program's goals and objectives.
5. Contribute to the broader discourse on decentralized governance within the AI and blockchain ecosystem, by providing a well-defined and practical model that can be adapted and adopted by other projects and communities.
6. Define the ways and means of communicating in the SingularityNET Ambassador Program, emphasizing decentralised, self-organised engagement. Provide guidelines for members to develop collaborative engagement with entities inside and outside the SingularityNET ecosystem.

By addressing these objectives, the whitepaper aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the proposed governance framework and its potential benefits for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program and the wider decentralized AI ecosystem.

### **2.1. Ambassadors Program Structure**

The SingularityNET Ambassadors program is aiming ¸to build a decentralized and community-driven initiative, providing a platform for individuals with diverse skills, talents, and passions to contribute to the growth and development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. The program's structure aims to facilitate decentralization, involvement, and collaboration.

At the core of the Ambassadors program are the individuals that form the workgroups and guilds, each dedicated to specific projects and areas of activity within the program. These workgroups and guilds bring together community members who share common interests and objectives, allowing them to collaborate on tasks, share ideas, and collectively drive the program forward.

Ambassadors can participate in various roles within the program, such as content creation, translation, social media moderation, event organization, and technical support, among others. The flexibility of these roles enables community members to contribute in ways that align with their unique skills, interests and capabilities, fostering a dynamic and inclusive environment within the program.

To further promote decentralization and community involvement, the program encourages community members to take the initiative in forming new workgroups and guilds based on their interests and the needs of the SingularityNET ecosystem. This bottom-up approach to program organization ensures that the Ambassadors program remains agile, responsive, and adaptive to the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized AI and blockchain technology.

### **2.2. Workgroups and Guilds**

The workgroups and guilds within the SingularityNET Ambassadors program are essential components that facilitate collaboration, specialization, and focus on various aspects of the ecosystem. These groups bring together ambassadors with specific skills, interests, and objectives, enabling them to work effectively on projects and activities that align with their expertise. Some of the current guilds within the program include:

1. **Marketing Guild**: The Marketing Guild is dedicated to building awareness of SingularityNET and its ecosystem. This group works on creating and distributing content, promoting events, and engaging with the community on various social media platforms. Ambassadors in this guild contribute to outreach efforts, public relations, and branding strategies to enhance the visibility and understanding of SingularityNET's mission and goals.
2. **Treasury Guild:** The Treasury Guild focuses on the financial operations, fund movements, and token distributions within the Ambassadors program. This group ensures transparency, and accountability related to the program's financial activities. Ambassadors in the Treasury Guild play a crucial role in managing resources and maintaining the financial health of the program.
3. **Process Guild:** The Process Guild is responsible for developing and improving the processes and operations of the Ambassadors program. This group works on identifying areas for improvement, streamlining workflows, and implementing best practices to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the program. Ambassadors in the Process Guild contribute their expertise in project management, process optimization, and quality assurance to support the ongoing evolution of the program.
4. **Strategy Guild**: The Strategy Guild focuses on building and refining the overall strategy for the Ambassadors program. This group works on setting goals, identifying opportunities, and planning initiatives that align with the program's mission and the broader objectives of the SingularityNET ecosystem. Ambassadors in the Strategy Guild contribute their strategic thinking, foresight, and analytical skills to ensure the program's continued growth and success.

These guilds represent a few examples of the diverse workgroups within the SingularityNET Ambassadors program, each playing a vital role in advancing the ecosystem. As the program continues to evolve, new guilds may be established to address emerging needs and opportunities, ensuring that the program remains dynamic and responsive to the ever-changing landscape of decentralized AI and blockchain technology.
