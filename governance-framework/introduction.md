## Introduction <a href="#_432yewfpf3f8" id="_432yewfpf3f8"></a>

The introduction provides an overview of the SingularityNET Ambassador Program. It aims to set the stage for the discussion of the new Governance Framework.

### **1.1. Purpose of the White Paper**

The purpose of this document is to ideate and propose a framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program.

The document itself should be seen as a process and not as a finished result.

The text you read now, may change a lot as ppl & thoughts join the process.

Let's try to find a way where everyone here feels comfortable to create together an environment in which we want to be and through which we are able to identify ourselves with. Lets learn from mistakes in history in order to innovate future…?.

This framework and the dedicated process being found and built as you read, and to empower engaged contributors, emphasize decentralization, and foster diversity and inclusion within the program. By developing the principles, design, and implementation strategies of the new governance framework, the whitepaper aims to provide a clear roadmap for engaged souls at the SingularityNET Ambassador program to better understand and adapt to the emerging system we build.

Moreover, the whitepaper serves as a comprehensive reference document for those interested in the inner workings of the SingularityNET Ambassadors program and its governance model.

It strives to ensure transparency and encourages open discussion, feedback, and collaboration within the community to continuously improve the framework.

Ultimately, the whitepaper seeks to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed governance framework and establish a solid foundation for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program as it continues to evolve and grow within an decentralized and on-chain AI ecosystem .

### **1.2. Background and Context**

The SingularityNET Ambassadors program was established in April 2022 to harness the passion and talents of community members, allowing them to contribute to the growth and development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. The program has seen the formation of various workgroups and guilds, each focusing on specific projects and areas of activity, ranging from content creation and translation to outreach and technical support.

As the program has grown and evolved, it has become increasingly important to have a robust and effective governance framework in place. This framework should enable decision-making processes that are decentralized, transparent, and fair, prioritizing the contributions and engagement of active members over the influence of token holders or popularity contests.

The development of a governance framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program is not only essential for the program's long-term success but also serves as an example for other decentralized projects and communities seeking to establish their own governance structures.

This document is set against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving world of decentralized AI and blockchain technology, in which innovative governance models are crucial for fostering growth, collaboration, and sustainability. By outlining the proposed governance framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program, this whitepaper contributes to the broader conversation on decentralized governance and provides a model that can be adapted and adopted by other projects within the ecosystem.

### **1.3. Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of this whitepaper is to present a comprehensive and detailed outline of the proposed governance framework for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program. To achieve this goal, the whitepaper aims to:

1. Define and explain the core principles and assumptions that underpin the governance framework, emphasizing aspects such as decentralization, empowerment of engaged contributors, and the importance of diversity and inclusion.
2. Provide a clear and concise description of the key components of the governance framework, including the use of project/guild native assets, token cycles, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making, and the implementation of NFTs for capturing engagements.
3. Offer guidance and strategies for the successful implementation and adoption of the governance framework, including a transition plan, stakeholder involvement, community onboarding path with ecosystem education, and monitoring and evaluation processes.
4. Encourage open discussion, feedback, and collaboration within the SingularityNET community and among stakeholders, to continuously refine and improve the governance framework and ensure its effectiveness in meeting the program's goals and objectives.
5. Contribute to the broader discourse on decentralized governance within the AI and blockchain ecosystem, by providing a well-defined and practical model that can be adapted and adopted by other projects and communities.
6. Define the ways and means of communicating in the SingularityNET Ambassador Program, emphasizing decentralised, self-organised engagement. Provide guidelines for members to develop collaborative engagement with entities inside and outside the SingularityNET ecosystem.

By addressing these objectives, the whitepaper aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the proposed governance framework and its potential benefits for the SingularityNET Ambassadors program and the wider decentralized AI ecosystem.
