### **2.1. Ambassadors Program Structure**

The SingularityNET Ambassadors program is aiming Â¸to build a decentralized and community-driven initiative, providing a platform for individuals with diverse skills, talents, and passions to contribute to the growth and development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. The program's structure aims to facilitate decentralization, involvement, and collaboration.

At the core of the Ambassadors program are the individuals that form the workgroups and guilds, each dedicated to specific projects and areas of activity within the program. These workgroups and guilds bring together community members who share common interests and objectives, allowing them to collaborate on tasks, share ideas, and collectively drive the program forward.

Ambassadors can participate in various roles within the program, such as content creation, translation, social media moderation, event organization, and technical support, among others. The flexibility of these roles enables community members to contribute in ways that align with their unique skills, interests and capabilities, fostering a dynamic and inclusive environment within the program.

To further promote decentralization and community involvement, the program encourages community members to take the initiative in forming new workgroups and guilds based on their interests and the needs of the SingularityNET ecosystem. This bottom-up approach to program organization ensures that the Ambassadors program remains agile, responsive, and adaptive to the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized AI and blockchain technology.

### **2.2. Workgroups and Guilds**

The workgroups and guilds within the SingularityNET Ambassadors program are essential components that facilitate collaboration, specialization, and focus on various aspects of the ecosystem.
