## Governance Framework <a href="#_rmq5fv5wbn5w" id="_rmq5fv5wbn5w"></a>

In this chapter, the proposed governance framework is presented in detail. It covers the use of project/guild native assets and token cycles, the distribution and utilization of tokens, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making, and the implementation of NFTs for capturing engagements. This section aims to provide a thorough understanding of how the governance framework is designed to function and the benefits it can bring to the program.

### **4.1. Project/Guild Native Assets and Token Cycles**

A key challenge is to create an equitable and effective governance framework that recognizes and rewards the contributions of its participants.

One innovative solution to this challenge is to implement cycle-based token minting for each guild, enabling the ecosystem to acknowledge the efforts of its active contributors while maintaining the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach.

Our proposed solution to this challenge is to implement cycle-based token minting for each guild, enabling the ecosystem to acknowledge the efforts of its active contributors while maintaining the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach.

The cycle-based token minting system involves creating native tokens for each guild based on fixed-duration cycles. These cycles can span several weeks or months, depending on the needs and preferences of each guild. By minting tokens within specific time frames, the ecosystem can recognize and reward the contributions made by its members during those periods. This approach ensures that the value of each token reflects the work and engagement of its holder within a given cycle.

This approach ensures that the value of each token reflects the work of its holder in a timely manner that is relevant to the contributions they make within a given cycle.

An important benefit of cycle-based token minting is that it helps to prevent external actors from "buying in" their stake in the ecosystem. Since tokens are only distributed to active contributors, the risk of tokens appearing on an exchange and being purchased by individuals with no genuine engagement in the project is reduced. This helps to maintain the decentralized and equitable nature of the governance framework and ensures that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated their commitment to the ecosystem.

We believe this will help to maintain the decentralized and equitable nature of the governance framework and ensure that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated their commitment to the ecosystem.

By implementing a cycle-based token minting system, the SingularityNET ecosystem can maintain the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach. Each guild operates as an independent and self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens reflecting the contributions of its members within specific time frames. This design encourages active participation in the governance process and rewards those who contribute meaningfully to the success of the ecosystem.

By implementing a cycle-based token minting system, our objective is the maintenance of a cellular-based governance approach within the SingularityNET ecosystem. Each guild will operate as an independent and self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens reflecting the contributions of its members within specific time frames. Our hope is that this design will encourage active participation in the governance process and reward those who contribute meaningfully to the success of the ecosystem.

In summary, cycle-based token minting for each guild is a powerful tool for promoting equitable and effective governance within the SingularityNET ecosystem. By recognizing the contributions of active participants and minimizing the influence of external actors, this approach helps to maintain the decentralized nature of the project and ensures that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated genuine engagement and commitment.

### **4.2. Distribution and Use of Tokens**

Tokens are distributed to ambassadors based on the tasks they complete within their respective guilds and working groups. Each token distribution is recorded in a transaction metadata that contains direct links to the accomplished tasks and the related received tokens. This transparency helps to create a clear record of each ambassador's contributions and promotes accountability within the ecosystem.

We intend to distribute tokens to ambassadors based on the tasks they complete within their respective guilds and working groups. Each token distribution will be recorded in transaction metadata that contains direct links to the accomplished tasks and the related received tokens. Our aim is to create a clear record of each ambassador's contributions promoting transparency and accountability within the ecosystem.

In an ideal case, the tokens would be used to vote on important governance decisions. However, we keep in mind that each Guild has their own native assets, and only the corresponding tokens can be used to vote in the specific Guilds and their decisions.

Furthermore, the use of tokens may include specific designs and use cases that apply to specific governance actions such as:

a) Proposal submissions

* Create and submit proposals to specific Guilds or the overall Ambassadors Program.

b) Special voting events

* Voting guided by a token’s context or meaning.

c) Informing the direction of the guild

* Tokens as a data source that may inform benevolent AGI or LLM.

_**Discussion:** Will the guild- cellular tokens be an expense drag? How will these cellular tokens be valued e.g 1 to 1 with $Agix?, Who and how will they be awarded? Will they be reputational only or have a convertable value, Could this be accomplished via NFTS? How, and who will administer these tokens if they are convertible?_



### **4.3. Workgroup/Guild-specific Decision-making**

4.3. Workgroup/Guild-specific Decision-making: Consent Mechanisms and NFT Holders

In the SingularityNET ecosystem, the decentralized nature of governance is maintained through a focus on workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes. To ensure that decisions are made by those who are actively engaged and committed to the project, the ecosystem employs consent mechanisms that grant decision-making power exclusively to NFT holders.

In the SingularityNET ecosystem we aim to maintain decentralized governance by focusing on workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes. This is to ensure that decisions are made by those who are actively engaged and committed to the project. The ecosystem will employ consent mechanisms that grant decision-making power exclusively to NFT holders.

Consent mechanisms are used to facilitate decision-making within workgroups and guilds, emphasizing collaboration, active listening, and a mutual understanding of the perspectives and expertise of each contributor. This approach is designed to create an inclusive and decentralized environment that fosters genuine agreement on key topics and initiatives.

Different consent mechanisms are used to facilitate decision-making within workgroups and guilds. Emphasizing collaboration, active listening, and a mutual understanding of the perspectives and expertise of each contributor. This approach is designed to create an inclusive and decentralized environment that fosters agreement and debate on key topics and initiatives.

By granting decision-making power solely to NFT holders, the SingularityNET ecosystem ensures that only those who have demonstrated their commitment and engagement in the project can influence its direction. NFT holders, as ambassadors who have received tokens for their contributions, have a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem and are well-equipped to make informed decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

By granting decision-making power solely to NFT holders, the SingularityNET ecosystem aims to ensure that only those who have demonstrated their commitment and engagement in the project can influence its direction. We believe that having a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem will encourage informed decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

In this context, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes are designed to be both efficient and effective. Each workgroup and guild operates as an independent, self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens and NFTs reflecting the contributions of its members. Decisions are made through consent mechanisms, in which NFT holders collaborate, listen, and reach agreements(consent/ consensus) \[Stephans view on consent vs consensus should be further explored imo] that are in the best interest of the project.

Decisions will be made through different methods of agreement specific to a group's needs. NFT holders (Ambassadors ? ) will collaborate, listen, reach a consensus or individually give consent.

(removed “best interest of the project” as this is a value judgment before the fact. Reworded to include the contingent “specific to a group's needs”. Eg. Decision making will vary according to a group's needs and culture.).

Decisions will be made through different methods of agreement specific to a group's needs. NFT-holders will collaborate, listen, and use either consensus or consent mechanisms, aiming to reach agreement in what they believe to be the best interests of the project.

### **4.4. NFTs for Capturing Engagements**

The role of NFTs in the SingularityNET ecosystem goes beyond merely serving as proof of an ambassador's engagement and contribution to the project. In this section, we will outline additional information and potential applications for NFTs within the context of the ecosystem that have not been discussed in previous chapters.

We envisage the role of NFTs in the SingularityNET ecosystem as going beyond proof of an ambassador's engagement and contribution to the project. In this section, we outline additional information and potential applications for NFTs within the context of the ecosystem that have not been discussed in previous chapters.

In addition to token distribution, the metadata of token transactions is directly fed into the metadata of contributors' NFTs. Each ambassador has their own NFT, which serves as a digital representation of their involvement in the SingularityNET ecosystem. These NFTs are minted as open policy NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring their accessibility, interoperability, and overall security.

In addition to token distribution, we plan to record the metadata of token transactions directly into the metadata of contributors' NFTs. Each ambassador will have their own NFT, which will serve as a digital representation of their involvement in the SingularityNET ecosystem. These NFTs will be minted as open policy NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring their accessibility, interoperability, and overall security.

As ambassadors receive more tokens for their contributions, their NFTs evolve through the growing metadata. This dynamic aspect of the NFTs provides a visual and tangible representation of each ambassador's commitment and impact within the ecosystem. It also serves as a form of social proof, showcasing their expertise and dedication to the project.

The intention is that as ambassadors receive more tokens for their contributions, their NFTs will evolve through the growing metadata. This dynamic aspect of the NFTs will provide a visual and tangible representation of each ambassador's commitment and impact within the ecosystem. It will also serve as a form of social proof, showcasing the ambassador's expertise and dedication to the project.

Furthermore, NFTs could provide additional utility such as :

1. **Unlocking exclusive benefits:** NFTs can be used to grant ambassadors access to exclusive events, resources, or opportunities within the SingularityNET ecosystem. As an ambassador's NFT evolves with their contributions, they may unlock additional perks and benefits, further incentivizing participation and fostering a sense of accomplishment and belonging within the community.
2. **Transferability and secondary markets**: While the primary focus of the NFTs is to represent an ambassador's contributions, there may be opportunities for secondary markets in which NFTs can be traded or sold. This would allow ambassadors to realize the value of their contributions beyond their direct involvement in the project. However, appropriate measures would need to be put in place to prevent potential manipulation or adverse effects on the ecosystem's governance.

The NFTs can have the discord id of the person in their metadata and DIDs can be used later on to prevent the transfer problem.

1. **Cross-collaboration among guilds:** NFTs can be used to facilitate cross-collaboration among different guilds and workgroups within the SingularityNET ecosystem. By recognizing the contributions made by ambassadors across multiple guilds, the ecosystem can promote cooperation and knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to more innovative and effective solutions.
2. **Showcasing ambassador achievements**: NFTs can also serve as digital badges, showcasing an ambassador's accomplishments within the SingularityNET ecosystem. These digital badges can be displayed on social media platforms, personal websites, or other online profiles, allowing ambassadors to share their involvement and achievements with a wider audience.
3. **Gamification and engagement**: The evolution of NFTs with an ambassador's contributions can introduce gamification elements to the ecosystem. By setting specific milestones or targets, ambassadors may be further motivated to participate and contribute, leading to a more engaged and active community.

In conclusion, the use of NFTs within the SingularityNET ecosystem extends beyond just representing an ambassador's engagement and contributions. By unlocking exclusive benefits, facilitating cross-collaboration, showcasing achievements, and introducing gamification elements, NFTs can play a crucial role in fostering a more connected, motivated, and innovative community, ultimately supporting the success of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

## Implementation and Adoption of the Governance Framework <a href="#_6siprtd7aiwt" id="_6siprtd7aiwt"></a>

Additionally, a communication strategy should be developed to keep the community informed about the progress of the implementation, addressing any questions or concerns that may arise.
4. **Transition and integration**: Once the technical infrastructure has been developed and tested, and the documentation and communication strategy is in place, the transition to the new governance framework can begin. This will involve the integration of the new framework into existing processes and systems, the distribution of native tokens and NFTs to ambassadors, and the establishment of workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes.
5. **Monitoring, evaluation, and iteration**: Following the implementation of the new governance framework, ongoing monitoring and evaluation will be necessary to ensure its effectiveness and alignment with the goals and values of the SingularityNET ecosystem. Feedback from the community should be actively solicited and incorporated into iterative improvements and refinements of the framework as needed. Recognizing this is V.1 of the Governance Framework future iterations, however achieved \[needs major discussion in light of our experience with current events] will be V.2, V.3 , etc.

The implementation of the governance framework within the SingularityNET ecosystem will be a dynamic and evolving process, requiring the active engagement and collaboration of all stakeholders. By following a clear and structured roadmap, the new framework can be successfully integrated, supporting the continued growth and success of the SingularityNET project.

### **5.2. Stakeholder Involvement and Community Education**

In order to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the proposed governance framework within the SingularityNET Ambassadors program, it is essential to establish and maintain a set of Best Practices. These best practices will help to promote a healthy governance ecosystem, fostering a culture of transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity. In this section, we will outline several key best practices that should be considered and adopted by the community.

1. **Open communication and transparenc**y: A healthy governance ecosystem relies on open communication and transparency. All stakeholders should be encouraged to share their thoughts, ideas, and concerns, fostering a collaborative environment in which the best decisions can be made. Transparent processes, such as public meetings and open documentation, should be utilized to ensure that all members of the SingularityNET ecosystem have access to the information they need to make informed decisions.
2. **Continuous learning and adaptation**: As the SingularityNET ecosystem evolves, so too should its governance framework. Regular reviews and assessments should be conducted to identify areas for improvement and to ensure that the framework remains aligned with the goals and values of the project. By embracing a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, the community can ensure that the governance ecosystem remains agile and responsive to changing needs and circumstances.

The SNET Ambassador may consider an _Ambassador University_ to enable and guide this learning for all community members and members of other organizations.

1. **Diversity and inclusion**: A healthy governance ecosystem is one that is diverse and inclusive, representing the full range of perspectives, skills, and experiences within the SingularityNET community. Efforts should be made to actively promote diversity and inclusion within the governance process, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. This includes supporting the participation of underrepresented groups and encouraging the formation of workgroups and guilds focused on diverse areas of interest.
2. **Conflict resolution and consensus building**: In any governance ecosystem, conflicts and disagreements are inevitable. Establishing clear and fair processes for conflict resolution and consensus building is crucial to maintaining a healthy governance environment. This includes promoting open dialogue and discussion, seeking compromise, and fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding.

\[should we develop a formal conflict resolution process, now or leave it for V.2 ?]

1. **Accountability and responsibility**: All stakeholders within the SingularityNET governance ecosystem should be held accountable for their actions and decisions. This includes ensuring that tasks are completed in a timely and efficient manner, that resources are allocated responsibly, and that the outcomes of decisions are monitored and evaluated. By fostering a culture of accountability and responsibility, the governance ecosystem can maintain its integrity and credibility.

\[ i think this may be the section to include a code of ethics for ambassadors.]

By adopting and maintaining these Best Practices, the SingularityNET Ambassadors program can create a healthy and thriving governance system that supports the continued growth and success of the project. Through open communication, continuous learning, diversity and inclusion, conflict resolution, and accountability, the governance framework can remain agile, responsive, and effective in achieving its goals.

### **5.3. Monitoring and Evaluation**

For the governance framework to remain effective and beneficial for the SingularityNET ecosystem, it is crucial to ensure its long-term sustainability. This requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including the community members, workgroups, guilds, and the core team, to consistently maintain and adapt the framework as needed. In this section, we will outline several strategies and considerations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the proposed governance framework.

1. **Resource allocation and management:** Efficient and responsible allocation and management of resources, such as tokens, time, and human capital, are critical to the long-term success of the governance framework. The community must prioritize activities and initiatives that contribute to the overall growth and success of the SingularityNET ecosystem, while also ensuring that resources are allocated fairly and transparently.
2. **Collaboration and knowledge sharing:** Fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing within the governance ecosystem is essential for its long-term sustainability. This includes creating opportunities for community members to work together on projects, share their expertise, and learn from one another. By leveraging the collective knowledge and skills of the community, the governance framework can continue to evolve and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.
3. **Scalability and adaptability**: As the SingularityNET ecosystem grows, the governance framework must be able to scale and adapt to accommodate new participants, projects, and initiatives. This includes regularly reviewing and updating the framework's processes and structures to ensure that they remain effective and responsive to the changing needs of the community.
4. **Education and onboarding:** Ensuring that new community members understand and can effectively participate in the governance framework is vital to its long-term sustainability.

5. **Monitoring and evaluation**: Regular monitoring and evaluation of the governance framework are essential to identify areas for improvement, measure progress, and ensure that the framework remains aligned with the goals and values of the SingularityNET ecosystem. This includes tracking key performance indicators, soliciting feedback from stakeholders, and conducting periodic reviews of the framework's effectiveness.

Monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) are crucial components of a successful governance framework, as they enable continuous improvement, adaptation, and alignment with the goals and values of the SingularityNET ecosystem. To ensure effective M\&E, the following considerations and methods can be employed:

1. Define clear objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs): Establishing well-defined objectives and KPIs for the governance framework and its various components allows for the measurement of progress and identification of areas in need of improvement. These KPIs should be aligned with the overall goals of the SingularityNET ecosystem and may include metrics such as community engagement, project success rates, token distribution fairness, and the effectiveness of decision-making processes.
2. Regular data collection and analysis: Consistently gathering and analyzing data on the performance of the governance framework is essential for effective M\&E. This includes collecting data on KPIs, as well as qualitative feedback from community members, workgroups, and guilds. The collected data should be analyzed to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.
3. Community feedback mechanisms: Encouraging community members to provide feedback on the governance framework and its processes is crucial for ensuring its effectiveness and relevance. This may include regular surveys, open forums for discussion, and channels for submitting suggestions or concerns. Actively incorporating this feedback into the ongoing M\&E process helps create a more responsive and adaptive governance framework.
4. Periodic review and reporting: Conducting regular reviews of the governance framework's performance and sharing the results with the community fosters transparency and accountability. These reviews should include an analysis of the collected data, progress towards objectives, and recommendations for improvement.

5. Adapt and iterate: Based on the insights gained from the M\&E process, the governance framework should be adapted and refined as needed to address identified challenges and capitalize on opportunities for improvement. This may involve making changes to processes, structures, or resource allocation to better align the framework with the needs and goals of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

By implementing a robust M\&E process that includes clear objectives, data collection and analysis, community feedback, periodic reviews, and ongoing adaptation, the governance framework can be continually optimized to support the long-term success of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

By implementing these strategies and taking a proactive approach to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the governance framework, the SingularityNET community can create a robust and resilient system that supports the continued growth and success of the ecosystem. Through effective resource management, collaboration, adaptability, education, and monitoring, the governance framework can remain an integral part of the SingularityNET project for years to come.

## Conclusion <a href="#_wb2j4aqd20fm" id="_wb2j4aqd20fm"></a>

The conclusion offers a summary of the governance framework and highlights its potential to improve the SingularityNET Ambassadors program. It also discusses future directions and opportunities for further development and refinement of the framework, as well as some final thoughts on the importance of effective governance in a decentralized ecosystem.

### **6.1. Summary of the Governance Framework**

The SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework is a decentralized and community-driven approach to decision-making and resource allocation, inspired by the cellular structure of the human body. The framework is designed to empower active and engaged contributors, foster diversity and inclusion, and prioritize consensus-based decision-making processes over traditional token-based voting systems.

Key components of the framework include:

1. **Cellular-inspired design:**

\[can this be document linked to the full section on this?] The governance framework consists of independent and self-sovereign working groups and guilds, each focusing on a specific aspect of the SingularityNET ecosystem. This cellular approach enables efficient scaling, promotes collaboration, and ensures that decisions are made by those with the most relevant experience and expertise.

1. **Separation of monetized tokens and governance**:

By decoupling token ownership from governance decisions, the framework aims to avoid the influence of large token holders (whales) and promote genuine engagement from contributors.

1. **Empowering engaged contributors**:

The framework favors contributors who actively participate and contribute to the ecosystem, offering more influence to those who demonstrate consistent commitment and expertise.

1. **Alternative decision-making processes**:

The framework emphasizes the focus on consent & consensus-based decision-making processes, prioritizing community engagement and collaboration over token-based voting systems.

1. **Emphasizing diversity and inclusion**:

The governance framework aims to create an inclusive and diverse environment, allowing for a wide range of perspectives and expertise to be incorporated into the decision-making process.

1. **Cycle-based native tokens**:

Each working group or guild issues its own native tokens based on cycles, ensuring that tokens are only distributed to active contributors and preventing external influence from token purchases.

1. **NFT-based contribution tracking**:

Contributors hold NFTs that capture their engagement and contributions within the ecosystem. These NFTs evolve as contributors earn more tokens, providing a transparent and decentralized way to track participation and influence within the governance framework.

1. **Monitoring and evaluation**:

The framework incorporates regular monitoring and evaluation processes to ensure its ongoing effectiveness, adaptability, and alignment with the goals and values of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

The SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework provides a flexible, decentralized, and community-driven approach to governance, designed to support the long-term success and growth of the SingularityNET ecosystem by empowering its most engaged and passionate contributors.

Key aspects of future developments and adaptability include:

1. Evolving roles and responsibilities: As the SingularityNET ecosystem expands, the roles and responsibilities of ambassadors will continue to evolve. New roles may be created, and existing roles may be refined to better align with the changing needs of the community.
2. Formation of new working groups and guilds: The cellular-inspired design of the governance framework allows for the easy creation of new working groups and guilds to address emerging areas of focus within the ecosystem. This flexibility ensures that the governance framework remains responsive to the community's needs and priorities.
3. Iterative improvements to decision-making processes: As the community gains experience with the consensus-based decision-making processes outlined in the governance framework, adjustments and refinements can be made to improve their effectiveness and efficiency.
4. Technological advancements: As blockchain technology continues to advance, the governance framework can incorporate new tools and approaches to enhance its functionality and performance. For example, improvements in NFT technology or the development of new decentralized applications (dApps) could be integrated into the framework to further support transparency, decentralization, and community-driven decision-making.
5. Ongoing community engagement and feedback: The success of the SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework depends on the active involvement and input of the community. Regular feedback and dialogue will be essential for identifying areas of improvement and ensuring that the governance framework remains aligned with the needs and values of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

By maintaining a focus on adaptability and responsiveness, the SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework can continue to evolve and grow alongside the SingularityNET ecosystem, ensuring that the community remains at the heart of the decision-making process and that the framework remains effective in supporting the long-term success of the project.

### **6.3. Final Thoughts**

The SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework is a novel attempt to harness the power of decentralized technology to create a more equitable, transparent, and inclusive decision-making process for a rapidly evolving AI ecosystem. By embracing the principles of decentralization, the framework empowers individual contributors while fostering a collaborative environment where the collective wisdom of the community guides the development of the ecosystem.

Drawing on the metaphor of cells in a living organism, the framework recognizes the importance of both autonomy and interdependence within complex systems. Just as cells work together in harmony to support the larger organism, the independent working groups and guilds within the SingularityNET ecosystem collaborate to promote the growth and development of the entire network. This cellular-inspired design highlights the potential for emergent behaviors and cooperative dynamics within decentralized systems.

Furthermore, the use of blockchain technology and tokenized incentives in the framework reflects a broader philosophical shift in our understanding of value, trust, and accountability. By leveraging the transparency, immutability, and cryptographic security of blockchain networks, the SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework demonstrates the potential of decentralized systems to redefine our notions of value, trust, and authority, placing the power of decision-making firmly in the hands of those most affected by the outcomes.

As we continue to grapple with the implications of rapidly advancing AI technologies, the SingularityNET Ambassador Governance Framework serves as a timely reminder of the importance of collaboration, diversity, and inclusion in shaping the future of AI. By embracing the principles of decentralization and building on the strengths of blockchain technology, the framework offers a promising vision of a more equitable and participatory future for the development and governance of AI and AGI systems.

Won't be finished at any state

Living document which will evolve into version documents ( E.g V1, v2 etc )

Define updates and change proposals to the document (similar to CIP process ?) (just without door keepers such as CIP’s & IOG)

## To be discussed <a href="#_5up6vf51ikpr" id="_5up6vf51ikpr"></a>

* Version control versus concurrency. My thought is version control. I believe it eliminates potential confusion. I do believe concurrency should exist in this living document, but until a Consensus or Consent is achieved by the community only the adopted Version should be the guide.
* Ideate and define signing process

( Multisig on Ambassador NFT & Workgroup holders to order the transaction to Treasury Guild ? ) I am exploring Summon Platform and their multisig.

* Ideate and define a incubation process to establish new roles, workgroups and Guilds
