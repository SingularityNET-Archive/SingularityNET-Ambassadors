## Governance Framework <a href="#_rmq5fv5wbn5w" id="_rmq5fv5wbn5w"></a>

In this chapter, the proposed governance framework is presented in detail. It covers the use of project/guild native assets and token cycles, the distribution and utilization of tokens, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making, and the implementation of NFTs for capturing engagements. This section aims to provide a thorough understanding of how the governance framework is designed to function and the benefits it can bring to the program.

### **4.1. Project/Guild Native Assets and Token Cycles**

A key challenge is to create an equitable and effective governance framework that recognizes and rewards the contributions of its participants.

One innovative solution to this challenge is to implement cycle-based token minting for each guild, enabling the ecosystem to acknowledge the efforts of its active contributors while maintaining the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach.

Our proposed solution to this challenge is to implement cycle-based token minting for each guild, enabling the ecosystem to acknowledge the efforts of its active contributors while maintaining the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach.

The cycle-based token minting system involves creating native tokens for each guild based on fixed-duration cycles. These cycles can span several weeks or months, depending on the needs and preferences of each guild. By minting tokens within specific time frames, the ecosystem can recognize and reward the contributions made by its members during those periods. This approach ensures that the value of each token reflects the work and engagement of its holder within a given cycle.

This approach ensures that the value of each token reflects the work of its holder in a timely manner that is relevant to the contributions they make within a given cycle.

An important benefit of cycle-based token minting is that it helps to prevent external actors from "buying in" their stake in the ecosystem. Since tokens are only distributed to active contributors, the risk of tokens appearing on an exchange and being purchased by individuals with no genuine engagement in the project is reduced. This helps to maintain the decentralized and equitable nature of the governance framework and ensures that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated their commitment to the ecosystem.

We believe this will help to maintain the decentralized and equitable nature of the governance framework and ensure that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated their commitment to the ecosystem.

By implementing a cycle-based token minting system, the SingularityNET ecosystem can maintain the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach. Each guild operates as an independent and self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens reflecting the contributions of its members within specific time frames. This design encourages active participation in the governance process and rewards those who contribute meaningfully to the success of the ecosystem.

By implementing a cycle-based token minting system, our objective is the maintenance of a cellular-based governance approach within the SingularityNET ecosystem. Each guild will operate as an independent and self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens reflecting the contributions of its members within specific time frames. Our hope is that this design will encourage active participation in the governance process and reward those who contribute meaningfully to the success of the ecosystem.

In summary, cycle-based token minting for each guild is a powerful tool for promoting equitable and effective governance within the SingularityNET ecosystem. By recognizing the contributions of active participants and minimizing the influence of external actors, this approach helps to maintain the decentralized nature of the project and ensures that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated genuine engagement and commitment.

### **4.2. Distribution and Use of Tokens**

Tokens are distributed to ambassadors based on the tasks they complete within their respective guilds and working groups. Each token distribution is recorded in a transaction metadata that contains direct links to the accomplished tasks and the related received tokens. This transparency helps to create a clear record of each ambassador's contributions and promotes accountability within the ecosystem.

We intend to distribute tokens to ambassadors based on the tasks they complete within their respective guilds and working groups. Each token distribution will be recorded in transaction metadata that contains direct links to the accomplished tasks and the related received tokens. Our aim is to create a clear record of each ambassador's contributions promoting transparency and accountability within the ecosystem.

In an ideal case, the tokens would be used to vote on important governance decisions. However, we keep in mind that each Guild has their own native assets, and only the corresponding tokens can be used to vote in the specific Guilds and their decisions.

Furthermore, the use of tokens may include specific designs and use cases that apply to specific governance actions such as:

a) Proposal submissions

* Create and submit proposals to specific Guilds or the overall Ambassadors Program.

b) Special voting events

* Voting guided by a token’s context or meaning.

c) Informing the direction of the guild

* Tokens as a data source that may inform benevolent AGI or LLM.

_**Discussion:** Will the guild- cellular tokens be an expense drag? How will these cellular tokens be valued e.g 1 to 1 with $Agix?, Who and how will they be awarded? Will they be reputational only or have a convertable value, Could this be accomplished via NFTS? How, and who will administer these tokens if they are convertible?_



### **4.3. Workgroup/Guild-specific Decision-making**

4.3. Workgroup/Guild-specific Decision-making: Consent Mechanisms and NFT Holders

In the SingularityNET ecosystem, the decentralized nature of governance is maintained through a focus on workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes. To ensure that decisions are made by those who are actively engaged and committed to the project, the ecosystem employs consent mechanisms that grant decision-making power exclusively to NFT holders.

In the SingularityNET ecosystem we aim to maintain decentralized governance by focusing on workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes. This is to ensure that decisions are made by those who are actively engaged and committed to the project. The ecosystem will employ consent mechanisms that grant decision-making power exclusively to NFT holders.

Consent mechanisms are used to facilitate decision-making within workgroups and guilds, emphasizing collaboration, active listening, and a mutual understanding of the perspectives and expertise of each contributor. This approach is designed to create an inclusive and decentralized environment that fosters genuine agreement on key topics and initiatives.

Different consent mechanisms are used to facilitate decision-making within workgroups and guilds. Emphasizing collaboration, active listening, and a mutual understanding of the perspectives and expertise of each contributor. This approach is designed to create an inclusive and decentralized environment that fosters agreement and debate on key topics and initiatives.

By granting decision-making power solely to NFT holders, the SingularityNET ecosystem ensures that only those who have demonstrated their commitment and engagement in the project can influence its direction. NFT holders, as ambassadors who have received tokens for their contributions, have a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem and are well-equipped to make informed decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

We believe that having a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem will encourage informed decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

In this context, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes are designed to be both efficient and effective. Each workgroup and guild operates as an independent, self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens and NFTs reflecting the contributions of its members. Decisions are made through consent mechanisms, in which NFT holders collaborate, listen, and reach agreements(consent/ consensus) \[Stephans view on consent vs consensus should be further explored imo] that are in the best interest of the project.

Decisions will be made through different methods of agreement specific to a group's needs. NFT holders (Ambassadors ? ) will collaborate, listen, reach a consensus or individually give consent.

(removed “best interest of the project” as this is a value judgment before the fact. Reworded to include the contingent “specific to a group's needs”. Eg. Decision making will vary according to a group's needs and culture.).

Decisions will be made through different methods of agreement specific to a group's needs. NFT-holders will collaborate, listen, and use either consensus or consent mechanisms, aiming to reach agreement in what they believe to be the best interests of the project.

### **4.4. NFTs for Capturing Engagements**

The role of NFTs in the SingularityNET ecosystem goes beyond merely serving as proof of an ambassador's engagement and contribution to the project. In this section, we will outline additional information and potential applications for NFTs within the context of the ecosystem that have not been discussed in previous chapters.

We envisage the role of NFTs in the SingularityNET ecosystem as going beyond proof of an ambassador's engagement and contribution to the project. In this section, we outline additional information and potential applications for NFTs within the context of the ecosystem that have not been discussed in previous chapters.

In addition to token distribution, the metadata of token transactions is directly fed into the metadata of contributors' NFTs. Each ambassador has their own NFT, which serves as a digital representation of their involvement in the SingularityNET ecosystem. These NFTs are minted as open policy NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring their accessibility, interoperability, and overall security.

In addition to token distribution, we plan to record the metadata of token transactions directly into the metadata of contributors' NFTs. Each ambassador will have their own NFT, which will serve as a digital representation of their involvement in the SingularityNET ecosystem. These NFTs will be minted as open policy NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring their accessibility, interoperability, and overall security.

As ambassadors receive more tokens for their contributions, their NFTs evolve through the growing metadata. This dynamic aspect of the NFTs provides a visual and tangible representation of each ambassador's commitment and impact within the ecosystem. It also serves as a form of social proof, showcasing their expertise and dedication to the project.

The intention is that as ambassadors receive more tokens for their contributions, their NFTs will evolve through the growing metadata. This dynamic aspect of the NFTs will provide a visual and tangible representation of each ambassador's commitment and impact within the ecosystem. It will also serve as a form of social proof, showcasing the ambassador's expertise and dedication to the project.

Furthermore, NFTs could provide additional utility such as :

1. **Unlocking exclusive benefits:** NFTs can be used to grant ambassadors access to exclusive events, resources, or opportunities within the SingularityNET ecosystem. As an ambassador's NFT evolves with their contributions, they may unlock additional perks and benefits, further incentivizing participation and fostering a sense of accomplishment and belonging within the community.
2. **Transferability and secondary markets**: While the primary focus of the NFTs is to represent an ambassador's contributions, there may be opportunities for secondary markets in which NFTs can be traded or sold. This would allow ambassadors to realize the value of their contributions beyond their direct involvement in the project. However, appropriate measures would need to be put in place to prevent potential manipulation or adverse effects on the ecosystem's governance.

The NFTs can have the discord id of the person in their metadata and DIDs can be used later on to prevent the transfer problem.

1. **Cross-collaboration among guilds:** NFTs can be used to facilitate cross-collaboration among different guilds and workgroups within the SingularityNET ecosystem. By recognizing the contributions made by ambassadors across multiple guilds, the ecosystem can promote cooperation and knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to more innovative and effective solutions.
2. **Showcasing ambassador achievements**: NFTs can also serve as digital badges, showcasing an ambassador's accomplishments within the SingularityNET ecosystem. These digital badges can be displayed on social media platforms, personal websites, or other online profiles, allowing ambassadors to share their involvement and achievements with a wider audience.
3. **Gamification and engagement**: The evolution of NFTs with an ambassador's contributions can introduce gamification elements to the ecosystem. By setting specific milestones or targets, ambassadors may be further motivated to participate and contribute, leading to a more engaged and active community.

In conclusion, the use of NFTs within the SingularityNET ecosystem extends beyond just representing an ambassador's engagement and contributions. By unlocking exclusive benefits, facilitating cross-collaboration, showcasing achievements, and introducing gamification elements, NFTs can play a crucial role in fostering a more connected, motivated, and innovative community, ultimately supporting the success of the SingularityNET ecosystem.
