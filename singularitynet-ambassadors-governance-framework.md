11. It should be understood the purpose of the guild is to promote The SingularityNet Ecosystem and partner projects in a responsible manner with a vision aligned with the foundations.
12. Actions or decisions of the SingularityNet Ambassador Guild should be weighed against perception regarding SingularityNet and responsible AGI as a whole.

Refined Assumptions:

Assumptions of Governance in the Ambassador Program:

1\. The purpose of the Ambassador Program is to grow awareness of the importance of decentralized, benevolent AI/AGI.

2\. Start small and start somewhere with the intention to allow ideas to evolve.

#### Governance Principles and Assumptions <a href="#_wskifdjdxlgb" id="_wskifdjdxlgb"></a>

This section outlines the key principles and assumptions that guide the development of the governance framework. These principles serve as the foundation upon which the framework is built, and they include aspects such as decentralization, empowerment of engaged contributors, alternative decision-making processes, and the importance of diversity and inclusion.

**3.1. Separation of Governance from Monetized Tokens**

3.1. Importance of separating monetized tokens from governance processes.

In a decentralized ecosystem like the SingularityNET Ambassadors program, the governance process plays a crucial role in ensuring fair, transparent, and efficient decision-making. One of the key aspects of establishing a robust governance framework is separating monetized tokens from the governance process. There are several reasons why this separation is essential:

1. Reducing Centralization: In a blockchain-based ecosystem, monetized tokens often represent economic power. By separating these tokens from the governance process, the framework aims to reduce centralization, allowing for a more decentralized and fair decision-making process. This ensures that large token holders (whales) do not unduly influence governance decisions.
2. Encouraging Active Participation: When governance decisions are detached from token ownership, it promotes active participation from community members who are genuinely engaged and committed to the project. This ensures that those who contribute their time, skills, and effort to the ecosystem have a say in shaping its future.
3. Fostering Inclusivity: Separating monetized tokens from governance processes allows for a more inclusive decision-making process, where diverse perspectives can be considered. This fosters a sense of belonging among community members and encourages them to actively participate in the project's growth and success.
4. Minimizing Conflicts of Interest: When the governance process is not tied to token ownership, potential conflicts of interest that could arise from financial incentives are minimized. This promotes more objective and unbiased decision-making, ensuring that the best interests of the ecosystem are prioritized.
5. Enhancing Decision Quality: By focusing on the contributions and expertise of engaged community members rather than solely on token ownership, the quality of decisions made in the governance process is likely to improve. This leads to more informed and well-rounded decisions that ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem.

In summary, separating monetized tokens from the governance process is crucial for creating a fair, transparent, and efficient decision-making framework in a decentralized ecosystem like the SingularityNET Ambassadors program. This separation fosters inclusivity, encourages active participation, minimizes conflicts of interest, and ultimately enhances the quality of decisions made within the ecosystem.

**3.2. Empowering Engaged Contributors**

The role of engaged contributors is crucial for ensuring that the platform remains dynamic, innovative, and inclusive. The governance framework must prioritize the contributions of active community members, creating an environment that fosters collaboration and growth.

Firstly, recognizing contributions is vital for fostering a sense of value and appreciation among community members. We intend to develop a system that acknowledges and rewards the efforts of active participants, regardless of their token ownership, the ecosystem can effectively motivate individuals to contribute their skills, knowledge, and time. This recognition can help create a sense of belonging and incentivize continued engagement.

Secondly, encouraging collaboration is essential for harnessing the collective intelligence and creativity of the community. By creating opportunities for community members to work together on projects, initiatives, and decision-making, the ecosystem can tap into the unique expertise and resources of its diverse participants. The formation of workgroups or guilds, focused on specific areas of interest, allows contributors to pool their efforts and drive progress in a collaborative manner.

Thirdly, facilitating skill development is an important aspect of empowering engaged contributors. By providing resources and opportunities for community members to develop and refine their skills, they can contribute more effectively to the ecosystem. Offering training, mentorship, or access to educational resources can support the growth and development of engaged contributors, ultimately benefiting the entire community.

Fourthly, creating inclusive opportunities ensures that the ecosystem caters to a diverse range of skills, backgrounds, and interests. By offering a variety of roles and responsibilities, community members with different talents and perspectives can contribute their unique abilities. This inclusivity not only values diversity but also encourages active participation from all members.

Lastly, nurturing a sense of ownership among community members is essential for the long-term success of the ecosystem. By providing the necessary tools, resources, and support, contributors can take a grass roots initiative to lead projects, propose changes, and actively participate in the governance process. This sense of ownership fosters a strong sense of commitment and responsibility towards the success of the program.

**3.3. Alternative Decision-making Processes**

In a decentralized ecosystem, adopting alternative governance and decision-making processes is essential to create a more inclusive, equitable, and effective environment. While blockchain token-based voting is a common method for implementing bottom-up decisions from ecosystem participants, it can sometimes lead to imbalances in power and decision-making authority.

Token-based voting systems can be influenced by large token holders, or "whales," who may dominate decisions due to their significant token ownership. This can lead to a concentration of power and decision-making authority, potentially undermining the principles of decentralization. To address this issue, it is crucial to explore alternative governance models and decision-making processes that prioritize the collective wisdom of the community over token ownership.

Consensus-based decision-making is one such alternative process that can help to promote inclusivity and balance within the ecosystem. By prioritizing consensus-building over simple majority voting, these processes ensure that diverse perspectives are considered, and decisions are made with the best interests of the entire community in mind. This approach fosters a more collaborative and equitable environment, where the voices of all participants are solicited, valued and taken into account.

Another important aspect of alternative governance models is the incorporation of innovative decision-making mechanisms, such as liquid democracy, quadratic voting, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These mechanisms offer novel ways to empower engaged contributors, promote fair and inclusive decision-making, and ensure that the ecosystem remains adaptable and resilient in the face of change.

A culture of experimentation and learning can enable exploration of alternative decision-making processes that aim for a decentralized ecosystem. By encouraging community members to explore and test new governance models and processes, the ecosystem can continuously evolve and improve, adapting to the changing needs and desires of its participants.

**3.4. Scaling through Decentralization**

The outlined design aims to recognize each guild and working group as an independent and self-sovereign entity, so that the ecosystem can efficiently scale and adapt to changing conditions, much like the cells in a human body. This essay will discuss the importance of embracing a cellular-inspired governance framework to ensure long-term success in a decentralized ecosystem.

One key aspect of this cellular-inspired governance model [based on a holacratic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy), is the emphasis on autonomy and self-sovereignty. By empowering each guild and working group to make decisions on their own behalf, the ecosystem promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility among its participants. This autonomy fosters a more engaged and committed community, which is better equipped to respond to challenges and opportunities as they arise.

Another important element of this governance model is the focus on keeping things small in order to scale large. Just as cells in a human body do not grow endlessly but rather duplicate themselves and interact to ensure overall performance, the same principle can be applied to the decentralized ecosystem. By encouraging the formation of smaller, specialized groups that can replicate and interact with one another, the ecosystem can achieve greater scalability and adaptability.

In addition, the cellular-inspired governance framework promotes the importance of interdependence and collaboration among the various groups within the ecosystem. Much like the cells in a human body, each guild and working group relies on the contributions of others to thrive and achieve its objectives. By fostering a culture of cooperation and shared purpose, the ecosystem can more effectively harness the collective intelligence of its participants and drive progress towards common goals.

Moreover, this governance model supports the idea of diversity and specialization within the ecosystem. By allowing each guild and working group to focus on their specific area of expertise, the ecosystem can tap into a wide range of skills, knowledge, and perspectives. This diversity not only fosters innovation but also ensures that the ecosystem remains resilient and adaptable in the face of change.

**3.5. Documentation and Transparency**

On-chain documentation of governance agreements is crucial for promoting transparency and trust within the decentralized ecosystem. By recording decisions, agreements, and actions on the blockchain, the ecosystem creates an immutable and tamper-proof record of its governance processes. This public record not only fosters trust among participants but also ensures that the ecosystem remains accountable to its values and objectives.

Off-chain documentation of governance agreements is equally important, as it enables more flexible and responsive decision-making. By keeping certain agreements and discussions off-chain, the ecosystem can engage in more in-depth deliberations and adapt more quickly to evolving conditions. This balance between on-chain and off-chain documentation ensures that the governance process remains agile and responsive to the needs of the SingularityNET community.

In the context of the cellular-inspired governance framework, the combination of on-chain and off-chain documentation enables each guild and working group to maintain a degree of autonomy while remaining accountable to the larger ecosystem. By documenting their decisions and agreements both on and off the blockchain, the groups can foster trust and collaboration among their members and ensure that their actions align with the shared goals of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

Furthermore, maintaining both on-chain and off-chain documentation of governance agreements helps to preserve the decentralized nature of the ecosystem. By allowing for various levels of documentation and decision-making, the ecosystem can avoid centralizing power or control, fostering a more inclusive and equitable environment for all participants.

In conclusion, the balance between on-chain and off-chain documentation of governance agreements is crucial for effective governance within a decentralized ecosystem like SingularityNET. By embracing this dual approach, the ecosystem can maintain transparency, accountability, and adaptability, ensuring that its governance framework remains aligned with its core values and objectives.

Adding: Governance documents and the generation process ideally be stored on the Cardano Blockchain to increase auditability and accountability and to improve the documentation while using the Blockchain as onchain history of governance documents which are approved by the program.

Changelog could be bridged on chain via transaction.

Text be transformed into JSON file (chunked files which match max size of transaction metadata volume )

Transaction be linked to single UTXO

**3.6. Avoiding Popularity and Representative Roles**

Popularity contests can distort the decision-making process in a decentralized ecosystem. When decisions are influenced by the popularity of certain individuals or groups, the governance process may become skewed towards the preferences of a select few rather than the collective wisdom of the entire community. This can lead to a centralization of power, which undermines the core principles of decentralization and may stifle innovation and diversity within the ecosystem.

Representative roles can also contribute to the centralization of power, as they often place the responsibility for decision-making in the hands of a limited number of individuals. This not only increases the risk of bias and manipulation but also discourages broader participation in the governance process. In a truly decentralized ecosystem, decision-making should be accessible and inclusive, enabling all members of the community to contribute their ideas, knowledge, and perspectives.

By avoiding popularity contests and representative roles, the decentralized ecosystem can prioritize merit and meaningful contributions over personal influence or charisma. This approach encourages all participants to engage actively in the governance process and fosters a more diverse and collaborative environment. In the context of the cellular-inspired governance framework, this emphasis on equitable participation ensures that each guild and working group can contribute meaningfully to the overall success of the ecosystem.

Furthermore, by eschewing popularity and representative roles, the ecosystem can more effectively adapt to change and embrace new ideas. When decisions are made by a diverse group of participants rather than a select few, the ecosystem is better positioned to identify and respond to emerging challenges and opportunities.

**3.7. Emphasizing Diversity and Inclusion**

Diversity and inclusion are essential for driving innovation within a decentralized ecosystem. A diverse community of participants brings together a broad array of ideas, experiences, and perspectives, which can spark creative solutions and novel approaches to problem-solving. In the context of the cellular-inspired governance framework, this diversity allows each guild and working group to contribute unique insights and capabilities to the overall success of the SingularityNET ecosystem.

Inclusion is closely tied to diversity and is a key factor in ensuring that all participants have the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the governance process. An inclusive environment encourages open dialogue and active participation from all members of the community, regardless of their background, expertise, or influence. By fostering a sense of belonging and valuing the input of all participants, the decentralized ecosystem can make more informed and well-rounded decisions that reflect the collective wisdom of the entire community.

Emphasizing diversity and inclusion in the governance framework also contributes to the resilience and adaptability of the ecosystem. A diverse and inclusive community is better equipped to identify and respond to emerging risks, challenges, and opportunities. By valuing the unique contributions of each guild and working group, the ecosystem can develop a more comprehensive understanding of its operating environment and evolve in response to changing circumstances.

In the context of the cellular-inspired governance framework, emphasizing diversity and inclusion ensures that each guild and working group operates as an independent and self-sovereign entity, while also contributing to the larger ecosystem. This approach fosters collaboration and mutual support among the various groups, enabling the ecosystem to function as a cohesive and adaptive whole.

#### Governance Framework <a href="#_rmq5fv5wbn5w" id="_rmq5fv5wbn5w"></a>

In this chapter, the proposed governance framework is presented in detail. It covers the use of project/guild native assets and token cycles, the distribution and utilization of tokens, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making, and the implementation of NFTs for capturing engagements. This section aims to provide a thorough understanding of how the governance framework is designed to function and the benefits it can bring to the program.

**4.1. Project/Guild Native Assets and Token Cycles**

A key challenge is to create an equitable and effective governance framework that recognizes and rewards the contributions of its participants.

One innovative solution to this challenge is to implement cycle-based token minting for each guild, enabling the ecosystem to acknowledge the efforts of its active contributors while maintaining the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach.

Our proposed solution to this challenge is to implement cycle-based token minting for each guild, enabling the ecosystem to acknowledge the efforts of its active contributors while maintaining the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach.

The cycle-based token minting system involves creating native tokens for each guild based on fixed-duration cycles. These cycles can span several weeks or months, depending on the needs and preferences of each guild. By minting tokens within specific time frames, the ecosystem can recognize and reward the contributions made by its members during those periods. This approach ensures that the value of each token reflects the work and engagement of its holder within a given cycle.

This approach ensures that the value of each token reflects the work of its holder in a timely manner that is relevant to the contributions they make within a given cycle.

An important benefit of cycle-based token minting is that it helps to prevent external actors from "buying in" their stake in the ecosystem. Since tokens are only distributed to active contributors, the risk of tokens appearing on an exchange and being purchased by individuals with no genuine engagement in the project is reduced. This helps to maintain the decentralized and equitable nature of the governance framework and ensures that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated their commitment to the ecosystem.

We believe this will help to maintain the decentralized and equitable nature of the governance framework and ensure that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated their commitment to the ecosystem.

By implementing a cycle-based token minting system, the SingularityNET ecosystem can maintain the integrity of its cellular-based governance approach. Each guild operates as an independent and self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens reflecting the contributions of its members within specific time frames. This design encourages active participation in the governance process and rewards those who contribute meaningfully to the success of the ecosystem.

By implementing a cycle-based token minting system, our objective is the maintenance of a cellular-based governance approach within the SingularityNET ecosystem. Each guild will operate as an independent and self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens reflecting the contributions of its members within specific time frames. Our hope is that this design will encourage active participation in the governance process and reward those who contribute meaningfully to the success of the ecosystem.

In summary, cycle-based token minting for each guild is a powerful tool for promoting equitable and effective governance within the SingularityNET ecosystem. By recognizing the contributions of active participants and minimizing the influence of external actors, this approach helps to maintain the decentralized nature of the project and ensures that decision-making power is held by those who have demonstrated genuine engagement and commitment.

**4.2. Distribution and Use of Tokens**

Tokens are distributed to ambassadors based on the tasks they complete within their respective guilds and working groups. Each token distribution is recorded in a transaction metadata that contains direct links to the accomplished tasks and the related received tokens. This transparency helps to create a clear record of each ambassador's contributions and promotes accountability within the ecosystem.

We intend to distribute tokens to ambassadors based on the tasks they complete within their respective guilds and working groups. Each token distribution will be recorded in transaction metadata that contains direct links to the accomplished tasks and the related received tokens. Our aim is to create a clear record of each ambassador's contributions promoting transparency and accountability within the ecosystem.

In an ideal case, the tokens would be used to vote on important governance decisions. However, we keep in mind that each Guild has their own native assets, and only the corresponding tokens can be used to vote in the specific Guilds and their decisions.

Furthermore, the use of tokens may include specific designs and use cases that apply to specific governance actions such as:

a) Proposal submissions

* Create and submit proposals to specific Guilds or the overall Ambassadors Program.

b) Special voting events

* Voting guided by a token’s context or meaning.

c) Informing the direction of the guild

* Tokens as a data source that may inform benevolent AGI or LLM.

_**Discussion:** Will the guild- cellular tokens be an expense drag? How will these cellular tokens be valued e.g 1 to 1 with $Agix?, Who and how will they be awarded? Will they be reputational only or have a convertable value, Could this be accomplished via NFTS? How, and who will administer these tokens if they are convertible?_



**4.3. Workgroup/Guild-specific Decision-making**

4.3. Workgroup/Guild-specific Decision-making: Consent Mechanisms and NFT Holders

In the SingularityNET ecosystem, the decentralized nature of governance is maintained through a focus on workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes. To ensure that decisions are made by those who are actively engaged and committed to the project, the ecosystem employs consent mechanisms that grant decision-making power exclusively to NFT holders.

In the SingularityNET ecosystem we aim to maintain decentralized governance by focusing on workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes. This is to ensure that decisions are made by those who are actively engaged and committed to the project. The ecosystem will employ consent mechanisms that grant decision-making power exclusively to NFT holders.

Consent mechanisms are used to facilitate decision-making within workgroups and guilds, emphasizing collaboration, active listening, and a mutual understanding of the perspectives and expertise of each contributor. This approach is designed to create an inclusive and decentralized environment that fosters genuine agreement on key topics and initiatives.

Different consent mechanisms are used to facilitate decision-making within workgroups and guilds. Emphasizing collaboration, active listening, and a mutual understanding of the perspectives and expertise of each contributor. This approach is designed to create an inclusive and decentralized environment that fosters agreement and debate on key topics and initiatives.

By granting decision-making power solely to NFT holders, the SingularityNET ecosystem ensures that only those who have demonstrated their commitment and engagement in the project can influence its direction. NFT holders, as ambassadors who have received tokens for their contributions, have a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem and are well-equipped to make informed decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

By granting decision-making power solely to NFT holders, the SingularityNET ecosystem aims to ensure that only those who have demonstrated their commitment and engagement in the project can influence its direction. We believe that having a vested interest in the success of the ecosystem will encourage informed decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

In this context, workgroup and guild-specific decision-making processes are designed to be both efficient and effective. Each workgroup and guild operates as an independent, self-sovereign entity, with its own native tokens and NFTs reflecting the contributions of its members. Decisions are made through consent mechanisms, in which NFT holders collaborate, listen, and reach agreements(consent/ consensus) \[Stephans view on consent vs consensus should be further explored imo] that are in the best interest of the project.

Decisions will be made through different methods of agreement specific to a group's needs. NFT holders (Ambassadors ? ) will collaborate, listen, reach a consensus or individually give consent.

(removed “best interest of the project” as this is a value judgment before the fact. Reworded to include the contingent “specific to a group's needs”. Eg. Decision making will vary according to a group's needs and culture.).

Decisions will be made through different methods of agreement specific to a group's needs. NFT-holders will collaborate, listen, and use either consensus or consent mechanisms, aiming to reach agreement in what they believe to be the best interests of the project.

**4.4. NFTs for Capturing Engagements**

The role of NFTs in the SingularityNET ecosystem goes beyond merely serving as proof of an ambassador's engagement and contribution to the project. In this section, we will outline additional information and potential applications for NFTs within the context of the ecosystem that have not been discussed in previous chapters.

We envisage the role of NFTs in the SingularityNET ecosystem as going beyond proof of an ambassador's engagement and contribution to the project. In this section, we outline additional information and potential applications for NFTs within the context of the ecosystem that have not been discussed in previous chapters.

In addition to token distribution, the metadata of token transactions is directly fed into the metadata of contributors' NFTs. Each ambassador has their own NFT, which serves as a digital representation of their involvement in the SingularityNET ecosystem. These NFTs are minted as open policy NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring their accessibility, interoperability, and overall security.

In addition to token distribution, we plan to record the metadata of token transactions directly into the metadata of contributors' NFTs. Each ambassador will have their own NFT, which will serve as a digital representation of their involvement in the SingularityNET ecosystem. These NFTs will be minted as open policy NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring their accessibility, interoperability, and overall security.

As ambassadors receive more tokens for their contributions, their NFTs evolve through the growing metadata. This dynamic aspect of the NFTs provides a visual and tangible representation of each ambassador's commitment and impact within the ecosystem. It also serves as a form of social proof, showcasing their expertise and dedication to the project.

The intention is that as ambassadors receive more tokens for their contributions, their NFTs will evolve through the growing metadata. This dynamic aspect of the NFTs will provide a visual and tangible representation of each ambassador's commitment and impact within the ecosystem. It will also serve as a form of social proof, showcasing the ambassador's expertise and dedication to the project.

Furthermore, NFTs could provide additional utility such as :

1. **Unlocking exclusive benefits:** NFTs can be used to grant ambassadors access to exclusive events, resources, or opportunities within the SingularityNET ecosystem. As an ambassador's NFT evolves with their contributions, they may unlock additional perks and benefits, further incentivizing participation and fostering a sense of accomplishment and belonging within the community.
2. **Transferability and secondary markets**: While the primary focus of the NFTs is to represent an ambassador's contributions, there may be opportunities for secondary markets in which NFTs can be traded or sold. This would allow ambassadors to realize the value of their contributions beyond their direct involvement in the project. However, appropriate measures would need to be put in place to prevent potential manipulation or adverse effects on the ecosystem's governance.

The NFTs can have the discord id of the person in their metadata and DIDs can be used later on to prevent the transfer problem.

1. **Cross-collaboration among guilds:** NFTs can be used to facilitate cross-collaboration among different guilds and workgroups within the SingularityNET ecosystem. By recognizing the contributions made by ambassadors across multiple guilds, the ecosystem can promote cooperation and knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to more innovative and effective solutions.
2. **Showcasing ambassador achievements**: NFTs can also serve as digital badges, showcasing an ambassador's accomplishments within the SingularityNET ecosystem. These digital badges can be displayed on social media platforms, personal websites, or other online profiles, allowing ambassadors to share their involvement and achievements with a wider audience.
3. **Gamification and engagement**: The evolution of NFTs with an ambassador's contributions can introduce gamification elements to the ecosystem. By setting specific milestones or targets, ambassadors may be further motivated to participate and contribute, leading to a more engaged and active community.

In conclusion, the use of NFTs within the SingularityNET ecosystem extends beyond just representing an ambassador's engagement and contributions. By unlocking exclusive benefits, facilitating cross-collaboration, showcasing achievements, and introducing gamification elements, NFTs can play a crucial role in fostering a more connected, motivated, and innovative community, ultimately supporting the success of the SingularityNET ecosystem.
