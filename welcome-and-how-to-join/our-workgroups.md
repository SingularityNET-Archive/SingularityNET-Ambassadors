{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an idea for a new WorkGroup, feel free to suggest it! You can raise it in Discord in the <mark style="color:red;">#ambassador-general</mark> channel, or in any meeting that feels relevant.

You don't necessarily have to be the one to set up and run the group, although you can if you'd like to.

New WorkGroups are expected to create a proposal for what they want to do, and a rough budget.
