{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an idea for a new WorkGroup, feel free to suggest it;although please note that the creation of new groups is currently suspended until the end of Q2 2025. You can still raise your idea in Discord in the <mark style="color:red;">#ambassador-general</mark> channel, or in any meeting that feels relevant.

You don't necessarily have to be the one to set up and run the group you are proposing, although you can if you'd like to.

New WorkGroups are expected to create a proposal for what they want to do, and a rough budget.
