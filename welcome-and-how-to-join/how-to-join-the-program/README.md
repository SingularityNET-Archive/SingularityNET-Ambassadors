# How to join the Program

The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is a bit different from other Ambassador programs you might have seen. We don't work only on promoting SingularityNET; we also work on strategy, governance, documentation, learning, and several other endeavours.

Becoming fully part of the program is a process, and it can take some time - and that's OK! You can go at your own pace.

Most of the work is done through our various [WorkGroups](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/welcome-and-how-to-join/our-workgroups). Joining one or more of them (you can join as many as you like) is the key to getting involved.

But there are some other simple steps that you'll need to do first, in order to get set up. Use the next 5 pages to go through these steps.
