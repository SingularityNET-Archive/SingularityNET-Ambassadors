# 2) Create a wallet and join Dework

It is required that you submit a Cardano based wallet address from wallets such as Eternl, Nami or Yoroi. This is used for distributing rewards for completed tasks. \
Fill the form [here](https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA).

Please be aware that this links your wallet address with your Discord name in a relatively public way. To protect your privacy, you might want to create a new wallet, which only has Ambassador Program transactions in it, and submit that. If you need help on how to create a wallet, please see [here](https://instance-dework-pbl.vercel.app/course/module/103/1034).\

Head over to [Dework and sign up](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas) using your Discord name. Dework is the tool we use to track people's work and contributions. If you're unfamiliar with Dework, here is a [short video](https://youtu.be/uCtXpnPQnaA) on how it works or you can read our [Dework PBL (Project-Based Learning) module](https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-lms-git-governance-g-1b84f0-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/201/2018) to find out about Dework in detail.

Once you're all set up, you are welcome to apply to any tasks that you see in Dework that you'd like to do. But note that some of the Program's work doesn't get posted as a Dework task - it gets assigned during the various WorkGroup meetings.\
