# 4) Get involved with WorkGroups

Workgroups are the main way that people contribute to the Ambassador program.

We have workgroups covering a wide range of different activities - from making videos to ideating on governance. You can join as many as you like.

Each WorkGroup is autonomous, and runs itself in its own way. The best way to find out if a group is your "thing" is to attend a meeting or two and see what you think.

And if you have any comments or feedback about a group, you can tell us, anonymously, using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckE\_kso56kdeJfYcfEezAzKJzcTqFJ6Ej9yySalpMN7SL1uw/viewform).

In the next section, you'll find an outline of what our current WorkGroups do.
