The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is a bit different from other Ambassador programs you might have seen.

Most of the work is done through our various WorkGroups. Joining one or more of them (you can join as many as you like) is the key to getting involved.

But there are a couple of other simple steps that you'll need to do first, in order to get set up. Use the next 5 pages to go through these steps.
