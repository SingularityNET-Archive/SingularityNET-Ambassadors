# 4) Create a wallet and join Dework

Dework is the tool we use to track people's work and contributions. Sign up [here](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas).&#x20;

Next, complete the [introduction task](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/team-tasks-25?taskId=188e1e95-97ea-4c85-be1c-c8323a4e442b). Remember to submit your Cardano native wallet address through the form embedded in the task - this is used for distributing rewards for completed tasks.&#x20;

Please be aware that this process links your wallet address with your Discord name in a relatively public way. To protect your privacy, you might want to create a new wallet, which only has Ambassador Program transactions in it, and submit that. \

If you need help on how to create a wallet,  [here's a short guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4kGaNOLLkI-xwJyg32s\_OrR4ojV3ODI1xmiUbxaQG0/edit?usp=sharing) on how to do it.

And if you're unfamiliar with Dework, below is a short video on how it works: or you can read our [Dework PBL (Project-Based Learning) module](https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-lms-git-governance-g-1b84f0-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/201/2018) to find out about Dework in detail.

Once you're all set up, you are welcome to apply to any tasks that you see in Dework that you'd like to do. But note that some of the Program's work doesn't get posted as a Dework task - it gets assigned during the various WorkGroup meetings.
