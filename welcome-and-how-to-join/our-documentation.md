# Our documentation

If you'd like to check what has been discussed in past meetings, the best way is to look at our [Archives](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/). The Archives is searchable, and contains a record of most Workgroup meetings. &#x20;

Some workgroups also maintain records on Miro Board: you can find links to these in the relevant meeting summaries in the Archives.

Meeting summaries are also copied to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/snet), in the #meeting-summaries channel; although this isn't as searchable as the Archives itself.

You can also watch recordings (full meetings and summaries) on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SNET\_Ambassador).&#x20;
