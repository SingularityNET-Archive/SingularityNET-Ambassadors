**Q: How do I become an Ambassador?** \
A: Getting involved with WorkGroups and Guilds is how you work towards becoming an Ambassador.

**Q: What kinds of tasks can I get involved with?** \
A: You can find various tasks on Dework - they include things like making videos, facilitation, documenting etc. You can also start a new workgroup if you have ideas for how to improve the Ambassador Program.

**Q: How can I find a task?** \
A: It varies from workgroup to workgroup. Most of the time tasks are assigned in the meeting or through discussions in the Discord channels. To learn about how to apply for Dework tasks, see [this video.](https://youtu.be/uCtXpnPQnaA) Some Workgroups provide bounties that you can apply for on Dework.

**Q: How long does it take to become an Ambassador?** \
A: There is an expectation that new members engage in different workgroups for several months before being considered for the ambassador role.

**Q: Which wallet to use?** \
A: It is advisable to use Cardano native wallets like Eternl, Nami, Typhon wallets, etc rather than using the likes of Trust wallet or Metamask. Also, with a wallet like Eternl, users can create an address book of recipients and up to 24 accounts from the exact mnemonic phrase. If you need help with how to create a wallet, [see our guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4kGaNOLLkI-xwJyg32s\_OrR4ojV3ODI1xmiUbxaQG0/edit?usp=sharing).

**Q: How do I get rewarded?** \
A. Once you submit a completed task, it will be reviewed and audited before being paid out in AGIX. You will be rewarded for completing tasks each week on Tuesdays. Kindly submit a Cardano wallet address by filling [this form](https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA) if you haven't done so already.

**Q: What are Gimbals?** \
A: A Gimbal (GMBL) is a token, originally created by [Gimbalabs](https://www.gimbalabs.com) in the Cardano Catalyst ecosystem. Although it can be traded on DEXs like any other token, it has no direct fiat value. Instead, it is used to track participation and engagement.&#x20;

Tasks such as meeting attendance can be rewarded with Gimbals; then the number of Gimbals that someone holds can be a measure of how much they have engaged. In SNET, each taskpoint in Dework is worth 100 GMBL. See our [Dework PBL](https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-lms-git-governance-g-1b84f0-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/201/2018) (Project-Based Learning) for more info on how we use GMBL to track participation.
