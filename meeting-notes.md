# Our documentation

If you'd like to check what has been discussed in past meetings, the best way is to look at our [Archives](https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/). The Archives is searchable, and contains a record of most Workgroup meetings.

The meeting summaries in the Archives are also posted to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/snet), in the #meeting-summaries channel. Some workgroups also maintain records on Miro Board: you can see the Program's Miro Board [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO0WVUBA=/).

You can also watch recordings (full meetings and summaries) on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SNET\_Ambassador).&#x20;
