# Review Process

#### Individual Review:

* Each reviewer watches the video independently.
* Reviewers use a standardized feedback form (see above for template).
* Reviewers complete their evaluations within a set timeframe.

#### Feedback Consolidation:

* Reviews are compiled (ideally, in a shared document or spreadsheet) and shared to the Workgroup.
* Contents would also go through a collective review by the WorkGroup.

#### Note:&#x20;

The review team can create content during their tenure but canâ€™t review their videos, those contents will be reviewed by the entire Workgroup.
