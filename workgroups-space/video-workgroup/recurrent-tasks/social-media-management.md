# Social media management

Social media management involves the following:

1. Posting videos and clips on all social media platforms once they are audited: Youtube, X, Instagram, TikTok
2. Updating the [content sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xqbs48KnfMBY\_NgMp\_Vo48dHrkEpr\_bCM0KfL7x7z4k/edit?usp=sharing) with the status of the posted videos.
3. Answering comments, and engaging with our community on our social media platforms.
4. Present a weekly brief in the workgroup’s meeting whenever it’s possible.
