# How rewards are distributed

### Where do Ambassador Program rewards come from?

SingularityNETâ€™s Supervisory Council gives 1/3 of its allocation to the Ambassador program. This is currently (until 20th May 2024) 57,648 AGIX, or roughly $16,000 per month. Any unspent budget carries over to the following month(s).

This is distributed to the WorkGroups according to the funding requests they have submitted, in line with their quarterly budgets. WorkGroups might reward members directly for their work, or create Dework bounties.

Workgroup task rewards tend to be around $10 to $20 per hour.

### Disbursement of rewards&#x20;

This is done by Treasury Guild on Tuesdays, using the system they developed for reward distribution. You can view the dashboard [here](https://treasuryguild.com/Singularity%20Net).

AGIX (the SingularityNET native token) are sent on the Cardano blockchain. To get rewards, you need to provide your public Cardano wallet address. You can submit your wallet + Discord username in [this form](https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA).
