# How we manage financial resources

Each workgroup is independent, and has its own way of managing its internal financial resources.&#x20;

But there are some assets, tools and processes that are used across the whole Ambassador program to manage financial resources:

* [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas) - A tool where WorkGroups can create bounties for the community.
* [Treasury Dashboard - Analytics Website](https://treasuryguild.com/Singularity%20Net) - This is Treasury Guild's self-built dashboard for tracking distribution of Ambassador Program rewards.
* [Treasury Dapp - Code GIT](https://github.com/treasuryguild/treasury-dapp) - A dApp, mostly JavaScript, to create treasury management transactions.
* [Treasury dashboard - Code GIT](https://github.com/treasuryguild/treasury-dashboard) - This is the repo for the treasury dashboard. Built with JavaScript.
* [Ambassador Tools - Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFAp0dm5Tmoh29EgxC9r5XTey\_EWeb9lRdrI0JCpbPk/edit?usp=sharing) - This document collects information about licenses we may want to use in the Ambassador Program.
* [Dework PBL Cardano Wallet Lesson - Andamio Lesson](https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-396alii9p-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/101/1014) - We build trust with people by educating them.
