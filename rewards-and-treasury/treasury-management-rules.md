# Treasury management rules

Our treasury management processes and rules change from time to time, by consent of the people active within the Ambassador Program. We support experimenting with different approaches to distributing funds.

Any current rules on fund distribution will be shared here.

***

### Treasury rules as of Q3 2024:

* Workgroups submit quarterly budget requests. These should be supported by a written proposal on what the Workgroup aims to do in that quarter and a quarterly report of the previous quarter.
* These requests are then put up for consent or objections by Core contributors.
* Any objections are addressed before the budget is approved.\
  Here is  the context-setting doc for the Q4 budget decision - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epegnWB0OMmM2JdAgT\_ENr8QiDn0lyg3f7eMDArY2qk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epegnWB0OMmM2JdAgT\_ENr8QiDn0lyg3f7eMDArY2qk/edit?usp=sharing)
