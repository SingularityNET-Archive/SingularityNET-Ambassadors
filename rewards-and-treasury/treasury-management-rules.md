# Treasury management rules

Our treasury management processes and rules change from time to time, by consent of the people active within the Ambassador Program. We support experimenting with different approaches to distributing funds.

Any current rules on fund distribution will be shared here.

***

### Treasury rules as of Q1 2024:

* Workgroups submit quarterly budget requests. These should be supported by a written proposal on what the WorkGroup's aims to do in that quarter.
* Fund requests for individual tasks can then be submitted by WorkGroup leads, via their group's own Dework space. To receive tokens from a Fund Request, move the task to "Review", add the fund receiver, and add the **Fund Request tag.** Tasks with the Fund Request tag will be exported to Treasury Manager each week, and will be audited.
* If a fund request is for over $100, the task on Dework should include some proof of deliverables, such as relevant weblinks or documents.
